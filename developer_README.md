# CONFIGURATION FOR DIRECTORY-WISE PULL/PUSH,ETC
For ordinary users, pull/push can only be done in the directory where this tool resides. but for the developers;
you can modify the code to also pull or push in any directory/folder, given the relative path to the folder where this code resides.

All you have to do is initiate developer mode, "nogit --alpha"
and Eureka, you can fill the required directory.

Developer mode allows access to silent mode (run nogit entirely with no output to the terminal), 
debug mode(, AI mode, hyper mode, and check mode.
